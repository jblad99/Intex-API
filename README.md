# first-api-accessible-ml-model
INTEX HACK!!! 
This code is my first attempt at making a machine learning model accesible through an API. I followed this tutorial to deploy the API https://dev.to/nick_langat/how-to-deploy-a-fastapi-app-to-aws-ec2-server-46d4 
This might be the route that my group and I go for intex to incorporate machine learning models into our web app. I thought it could be useful to some folks. 
Check out the App.py file to see how the actual model (the model.pkl) is opened, read, and used by the api. 
By the end, you should be able to use postman as shown and it'll work!
